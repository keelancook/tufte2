## My Commonplace Book

The commonplace book has a long history and deep roots. For hundreds of years, scholars, writers, and thinkers carried what amounts to a scrapbook that they used to compile all of their notes.

Primarily, the notes in [my commonplace book](https://commonplace.ml) will deal with topics of theology and ministry. By thinking in public, instead of keeping these notes closed up, I hope my thoughts here will benefit others. And perhaps, these thoughts will be sharpened as well.

## Church Renewal

Revitalization has been a topic for a while, but as the generational turnover and rapid cultural shifts in our nation are occurring, there is a resulting wave of declining churches. The process of replanting steps into that gap. Replanting is often a more radical process than traditional revitalization. Itâ€™s the process of relaunching a church with a different identity and structure after a period of intense assessment and reconfiguration.
