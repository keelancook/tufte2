I periodically get asked for video resources concerning the Peoples Next Door project and missions in general. People are often looking for a short video that sums up some of the concepts addressed here on the blog. If you are one of those people, then this may be a resource for you.

Last week at Southeastern, we held our annual Go Conference. It is the school's main conference and this year was dedicated to global missions. During the conference, I had a chance to give a quick talk on the nature of missions and how we can now reach the nations in at least two directions.

I would encourage you to give the video (15 minutes) a watch if you think it might be a resource you could share with others. In addition, you can find all the conference videos on the Southeastern Vimeo page. It was a solid conference with the likes of David Platt, Afshin Ziafat, and Danny Akin.
