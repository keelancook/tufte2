Is your church thinking through how to reach the international people who live around you? Are you trying to cast a vision for this process? If so, this short video may be helpful.

In our efforts to equip local churches for people group discovery and engagement in their neighborhoods, we will be producing resources in the coming months that aid in that purpose. This video is one of the first.

Share it with your church, and share it with your friends. Let's get people talking about this new day in international missions, about all the peoples next door.
