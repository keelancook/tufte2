> "Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
> 
> The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.'
> 
> But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner!'
> 
> I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted." ~ _Jesus (Luke 18:10-14)_

Often times, God's word can speak louder and clearer than anything we could add.

Trust not in your own righteousness.
