**CORRECTION! I originally said this webinar begins at 3pm EST, but it is 2pm EST. So, it's in 1 hour!**

If you and your church are like many, you see the gospel opportunities around you to reach peoples from all over the world. I am thankful for the growing number of resources available to help churches start this process, and today I want to let you in on one. This afternoon at 2pm EST, I will be hosting a free webinar alongside Caleb Bridges on a process for discovering people groups in your community. This webinar is one of a two-part series hosted by Caleb and myself dedicated to discovering and engaging people groups. Today, we talk about discovery. In the next one, we will discuss engagement.

Our goal is to answer the two foundational questions involved in this work: (1) Who is here? and (2) What do we do when we find them? Every church that wants to be faithful to the Great Commission in their own community needs to be able to answer these two questions. This afternoon, Caleb and I will address the first question, and we would love for you to join us.

The webinar is hosted by [ethnéCITY.com](http://ethnecity.com). This website is an initiative by the IMB to provide tools and resources to churches across North America to meet the needs of increasing diversity around them with healthy gospel ministry. It is a treasure trove of videos, articles, tools, and resources. I would encourage you to check it out.
