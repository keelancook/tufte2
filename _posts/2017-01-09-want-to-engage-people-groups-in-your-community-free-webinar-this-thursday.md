Back in December, I announced a free webinar over at [ethnéCITY.com](http://ethnecity.com/) that I cohosted. In that webinar we covered the process of people group discovery for churches and agencies interested in simply ways to find out about people groups around your community. Today, I want to let you know about the follow-up webinar that will be taking place this Thursday at 2 pm EST. Last month, we talked about discovery. In the next one, we will discuss engagement.

If you and your church are like many, you see the gospel opportunities around you to reach peoples from all over the world. I am thankful for the growing number of resources available to help churches start this process.

Our goal is to answer the two foundational questions involved in this work: (1) Who is here? and (2) What do we do when we find them? Every church that wants to be faithful to the Great Commission in their own community needs to be able to answer these two questions. Thursday, Caleb Bridges and I will address that second question, and we would love for you to join us.

The webinar is hosted by [ethnéCITY.com](http://ethnecity.com/). This website is an initiative by the IMB to provide tools and resources to churches across North America to meet the needs of increasing diversity around them with healthy gospel ministry. It is a treasure trove of videos, articles, tools, and resources. I would encourage you to check it out.

You can go sign up for the free webinar right now by clicking on the sign up image below. Make sure you join us Thursday!
