This is a few months old at this point, but I realized I had never made people aware of it through this site. Back in November, the Pew Research Center released a great tool concerning refugees in the United States. The tool is completely interactive and provides both a map animation and a workable table broken down by state for each year from 2002 until 2017.

For each state, the largest nationality is identified and a total is given for each year. It's really interesting to see the flow of refugees during particular years. For instance, the animation illustrates the rise of Burmese refugee settlement starting in 2007 and climaxing in 2012.

I've included the tool below. The map animation may only show up on desktop devices, but you should be able to access the table on any device. If you have problems with the embedded version on my site, you can always access [the Pew Research version here](http://www.pewglobal.org/interactives/where-have-refugees-settled-in-the-u-s/).

Give it a try!
