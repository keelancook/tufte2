Â 

Today, I want to take a moment and highlight a simple resource for local church pastors, especially of the student variety. If you have never taken your students on a "people group excursion," then you should.

[Tiffany Smith](https://twitter.com/tiffanydsmith) works for the North American Mission Board and recently wrote a guest post at the Collegiate Collective casting a vision for people group excursions. In short, a people group excursion (or people group immersion, as some call them) is a great way to highlight the cross-cultural ministry needs in your area. With a little prep work, you can introduce your young believers to the people groups in the area and start them on a path to intercultural engagement at home.

I'll let Tiffany give you the details. Go check out the post here:
