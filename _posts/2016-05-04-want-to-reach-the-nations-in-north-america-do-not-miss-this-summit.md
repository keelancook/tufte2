I am excited about this event. Over the last several years, after I returned from the mission field in West Africa, I have watched this conversation move from relative obscurity, up onto the table for discussion, and now into action in many places around the country. It has been amazing to watch as people realized the Great Commission opportunity presented to us by global migration of the unreached peoples to communities and neighborhoods all around our churches. Now, the movement is catching on, and people are starting to ask questions about how to get involved in this kind of ministry.

That is what this summit is all about.

It is very encouraging to see the large amount of cooperation to make this happen. Various sending agencies, seminaries, and state conventions are partnering together to bring what we are hoping is the biggest discussion on this issue to date. I am excited to be a part of the action. Southeastern has signed on as a sponsor for this event, and I will be helping lead a breakout session alongside many people much more qualified than myself. We are pretty pumped about helping bring this to churches, associations, and conventions around the country. It should be packed with information, and more importantly, opportunities to meet people doing this work around the country.

The summit is open to anyone interested in this topic, but I want to point out a few people that should definitely try to be there.

## Pastors and Local Church Leaders

If you serve in a church that has a heart for the nations, then we want you to come experience this. Our primary goal is serving local churches by training and equipping them to discover and engage people groups. To this end, we really want pastors and church leaders to come and join the conversation. Pastor, consider bringing a whole group from your church to think through ways that you can get serious about reaching the nations here.

## Denominational Leaders

If you work in an association or convention, then the summit has a track specifically designed for you to interact with others about how to lead churches in engaging people groups. We already have a number of associational and convention leaders signed on for the event, and we encourage you to come be part of the conversation. Hear what others are doing around the country, and learn best practices that can be applied in your area.

## Academic Professionals

We plan to have conversations specifically designed around the college and seminary setting for training students to do this work. If you are a professor, we want to create conversation about teaching our next generation of ministers how to engage the new North American landscape. If you teach missions or church planting, or are currently involved in diaspora missiology research and instruction, then this conference is for you.

## College and Seminary Students - It's free for you!

And I am especially excited about this last category. This past week, we decided to make registration completely free for any college and seminary student. Do not pass up this opportunity to spend a few days in Nashville, learning about this crucial topic. Students are the next generation of ministers, and we want to make sure they have easy access to the conversation.
