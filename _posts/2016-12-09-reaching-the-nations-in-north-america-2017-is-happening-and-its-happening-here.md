I have been sitting on this piece of news for a while now, but we are finally ready to make the big announcement. Southeastern is officially hosting Reaching the Nations in North America in 2017!

Last year's RTN Summit in Nashville, TN was a great success. We had hundreds of people come from all over the country, from missions agencies, conventions, associations, and a whole host of churches. The conversation was great, and after last year's success, we knew we needed to host another summit in 2017. This year, we will be holding the conference on campus here in Wake Forest. We expect to see an even larger number of attendees, and we have room to grow!

Reaching the Nations in North America is a really great concept. It is a joint initiative by several of our SBC entities (IMB, NAMB, NC Baptists, SEBTS, and others) to offer equipping for local churches to discover and engage people groups right here in North America. It seems each week, I hear about more churches who are seeing the significance of this Great Commission opportunity right in front of us. RTN2017 is geared toward helping these churches (and organizations who work with these churches) cast vision, craft strategy, and begin healthy missions toward the nations in our neighborhoods. We already have a great line-up of speakers and sessions, and we will be announcing these soon.

You can learn all about RTN2017 at the new website: [ReachingTheNations.net](http://reachingthenations.net). Go check it out, and visit it periodically as we update the site with news and important announcements about speakers and summit details. Oh, and help us spread the word. We want as many churches and organizations as possible to be a part of the movement!
