Today is the day for the Reaching the Nations in North America summit in Nashville, The response has been phenomenal, with registration exceeding anything we imagined. And for those of you who wanted to be here but couldn't make it, we have one more opportunity for you to join in!

The International Mission Board will be streaming the keynote sessions for free on Facebook live, and all you have to do to join us is click the big red button below. That will take you to the IMB Facebook page where the event will be streamed. The event kicks off tonight at 6:30 pm (central time) with Ed Stetzer discussing the biblical mandate for diaspora ministry. You can also catch Jenny Yang at 7:45 pm and JD Payne tomorrow (Aug. 27) at 2 pm.

The summit will last for the next two days, and we will hear from a long list of missions researchers and practitioners on reaching the nations right here in our own communities. Hundreds have signed up, and we finally had to shut off registration because we were running out of space! I am encouraged so many are concerned about the important topic of reaching people groups here in North America. You can help us out by letting others know they can watch along. Share the news about the live streaming option, and join us yourself if you are not already in the Music City!
