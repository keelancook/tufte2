\[pullquote align="right" cite="" link="" color="" class="" size=""\]Wednesday, December 9, I will lead a training called "Cultural acquisition:  How to equip people to discover culture and worldview."\[/pullquote\]

 

I wanted to take a moment and invite you all to sign up for a free online workshop I will be conducting next week. The IMB has a wonderful resource website called [ethneCITY.com](http://ethnecity.com). The purpose of ethneCITY is, as they put it on the website, "Reaching the unreached in the urban setting." Not only does the website serve as a repository for various resources geared toward this work, they also host online trainings and serve as a collaboration point for churches and organizations attempting to engage people groups here in the US.

Next Wednesday, December 9, I will lead an online training called "Cultural acquisition: How to equip people to discover culture and worldview." This training will provide simple equipping tools for anyone interested in learning the cultures of different people groups in their communities. If you are a ministry leader in a church, at a missions organization, or even a lay person in a church who simply wants to learn how to understand different cultures around you, then this workshop is for you.

My goal is to make the work of cultural acquisition simple and understandable without a lot of jargon. I firmly believe [people do not have to be cultural anthropologists or professional missionaries to engage people groups](http://blog.keelancook.com/2015/10/engaging-people-groups-cultural-expertise-vs-cultural-acquisition.html) around them. However, it is important for people to start the journey of understanding the cultural differences between them and the people they are trying to reach. [By asking the right questions](http://blog.keelancook.com/2015/10/culture-in-5-easy-to-understand-categories.html), and listening for specific answers, anyone can learn what is necessary to speak the gospel to people from a different culture with both respect and understanding.

By no means will this be an exhaustive training. We are just touching the surface of cultural acquisition, but my hope is that ministry leaders and participants can go away with some practical tools to teach others and begin the work themselves.

If you're interested in being a part of the conversation, head over to ethneCITY.com and sign up.
