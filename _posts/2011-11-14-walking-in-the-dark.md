It is funny how life has a way of coming back around to the same point. Despite a seemingly linear movement down life's road, we often find ourselves stumbling across signposts and circumstances that make us feel we have visited a place before.

This morning, I found myself reading old posts on my blog. Keep in mind, for you this may simply be a collection of articles, interesting or otherwise. For me, it is my journal. It is my life laid out in ink (howbeit digital) and I often find myself revisiting stories so that I can recount God's work in my own life.

One post in particular struck a chord.

In May of 2010, I wrote a post about walking in faith. It was a point in my life where I was struggling with a lot of uncertainty about my future. I had decisions to make concerning my next steps in life and relationships with others, and I felt as though I was walking in the dark.

Today, instead of writing out a new post, I thought I would share this one.

It is called [Steps in the Darkness](http://blog.keelancook.com/2010/05/steps-in-the-darkness.html "Steps in the Darkness"). Give it a read.
